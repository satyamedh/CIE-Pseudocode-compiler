# CIE Pseudo-Code Compiler

This is a pseudo-code compiler for the CIE IGCSE and AS&A Levels Computer Science course. It is designed to be used with 0478/9718/9708.

## Small rant
WHY IS IT CALLED PSEUDOCODE IF IT CAN BE COMPILED? IT'S NOT PSEUDOCODE IF IT CAN BE COMPILED. IT'S A REAL PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. IT'S NOT PSEUDO.

## Features
NONE so far. I'm working on it ;)
